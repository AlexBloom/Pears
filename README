Pears are common patterns of markup & style.

Pears is an open source WordPress theme. I'll admit the code 
is a bit rough, initially based on the default 'twentyone' theme.

I wanted a handy way of collecting HTML & CSS pattern pairs. 
Often used modules with a minimal of style applied. It's become 
a valuable learning tool, whereby breaking interfaces down into 
small pieces make it easier to learn and improve running code.
